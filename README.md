Algorithms
    Searching Techniques
        1. Linear Search [TC = O(N)]
    *   2. Binary Search [TC =O(LOG N)]

    Basic Sorting Techniques
        1. Bubble Sort [TC=O(N2)]
        2. Selection Sort [TC=O(N2)]
        3. Insertion Sort [TC=O(N2)]



Basic-java-programs
    1. Area of circle
    2. Area of Square
    3. Average of 3 number
    4. Pattern using simple println statement
    5. Total Bill Generator for given 3 items
    6. Operators in java

Conditional-Statements
    1. Income Tax calculator
    2. Largest of 3 numbers
    3. Check if the number is Odd or Even
    4. Number is Prime or not --[using modulo (from 2 to n-1) becoz both prime and composite num is divisible by itself and 1]
    5. Ternary operator program to check if num is Odd or Even
    6. Calculator using Switch 
    7. Else if program to display the age group
    
Loops
    1. Reverse of a number
    2. Input number till user Enter the multiple of 10
    3. Display output of num that is not multiple of 10
    4. Check if num is prime or not using for Loop

Patterns[Nested-for-loops]
    1.

Data-Structures

    Arrays
        1. Perform operations on Array-Create, Update, Input, Output
        2. Find the sum of all the subarrays in the array
        3. Maximum Subarray Sum
            a. Brute force approach [TC=O(n3)]
            b. Prefix sum approach[TC=O(n2)]
        4.
